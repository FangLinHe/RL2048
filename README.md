# RL2048

This project aims to implement a Python version of [2048 game](https://play2048.co/) and train an RL model to play the game.

## Implement 2048 Game with Python

To implement the game, we first need to use some module to implement the game interface. Not doing much of research, I found the [Python module `turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) easy to use, so I chose it as the starting point ([ref](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/easy-games-in-python)).
